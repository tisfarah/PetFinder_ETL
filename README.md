# PetFinder_ETL

This is an ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) project done by Daniel Mihok and Farah Clerveau. We extracted and combined data from the following disparate sources: PetFinder API, "Most Pet-Friendly Cities" article from Wallet Hub, and the "Top Dog Breeds" article from American Kennel Club. This data was extracted using multiple Python libaries and modules and ultimately loaded into a MySQL Database.
